# Emailing_App

A simple command line app to send emails using the yagmail library and environment variables to hide password in user's machine.

As a safety measure, this program does not prompt the user for a password but imports it from an environment variable.

To create an environment variable, please refer to:

Hope you like the app,
Enjoy!
